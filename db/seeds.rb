	bio:'There are few names in dance music today which need less of an introduction than Masters At Work. The duo of Louie Vega and Kenny Dope have forged a reputation for genre-eschewing DJ sets and flawless house productions during careers which have spanned three decades. Their sound was born out of New York when Disco was at its peak, seeing the emergence of house and hip-hop in their home city, the pair managed to amalgamate that mix along with a healthy dollop of Latin styles and jazz to create records that are still being copied and referenced – but crucially never eclipsed – by many of today’s contemporary producers.',
